# Guest Talk at Makers Academy

~30 minutes talk about [Grunt task runner](https://www.google.com), covering the basics:

* what is it, what are the benefits
* how to install, configure, use grunt
* some additional thoughts...

## Slides

Slides are only used as a very general guideline. Most of the explanation requires
live demonstration of grunt.

Slides can be found here: http://lisastoz.github.io/grunt-guest-talk

Slides are built with [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/),

## Handout

Handout is used as a starting point for live demonstration of grunt.
It can be downloaded here: https://github.com/LisaStoz/grunt-guest-talk/tree/handout

During the demo initial handout gets modified and in the end it should be looking
like this: https://github.com/LisaStoz/grunt-guest-talk/tree/final

## Explanation

I wrote a blog post that is quite close to what I talked about during a demo (a bit simplified):
